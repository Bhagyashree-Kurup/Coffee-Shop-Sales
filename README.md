# Pizza Sales Power BI Dashboard
This is a dynamic Power BI dashboard focused on Pizza Sales, that I've created using a dataset from Data Tutorials! 🍕📊
This interactive dashboard dives deep into the Pizza Sales data. I've used different measures and transformed the data to get valuable insights about different KPIs, Daily & Monthly Sales Trends 📈, Pizza Categories & Sizes with the highest and lowest contributions, Best & Worst Selling Pizzas by category, Total orders, and Revenue. I've added dynamic slicers for pizza category and date range to enhance exploration and analysis. This provides a clear view of the sales performance, helping us identify key trends and optimize the strategy.
Take a look and see how data can drive delicious insights!
